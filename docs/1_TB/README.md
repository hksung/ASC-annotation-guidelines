# Theoretical Background

In cognitive linguistics, a construction represents a form-meaning pair. Constructions can exist at the syntactic/lexicogrammatical level, wherein a verb and its argument structure constitute a form that corresponds to a propositional meaning (e.g., Diessel, 2004; Fillmore, Kay, & Oâ€™Connor, 1988; Goldberg, 1995, 2003, 2006; Jackendoff, 2002). These constructions are referred to as argument structure constructions (ASCs).
