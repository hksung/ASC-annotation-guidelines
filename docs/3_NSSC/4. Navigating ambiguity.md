# Navigating ambiguity

## CAUS_MOT vs. TRAN_RES

### CAUS_MOT
CAUS_MOT typically contains a non-stative verb and **a directional phrase**.

The following are some example sentences (Goldberg, 1995, p.152)
```
- They laughed the poor guy out of the room.
- Frank sneezed the tissue off the table.
- Mary urged Bill into the house.
- Sue let the water out of the bathtub.
- Sam helped him into the car.
- They sprayed the paint onto the wall.
```

CAUS_MOT is associated with a category of related verb senses (Goldberg, 1995, pp. 161-162)
1. X CAUSES Y to MOVE Z
```
- Frank pushed it into the box.
- Frank kicked the dog into the bathroom.
- Frank sneezed the tissue off the nightstand.
- Sam shoved it into the carton.
- Pat crammed the pennies into the jar.
```

2. Sometimes the construction can be related to force-dynamic verbs (Talmy 1985b) that encode a communicative verb.
(In this case, the motion ins not strictly entailed.)
```
- Sam ordered him out of the house.
- Sam asked him into the room.
- Sam invited him out to her cabin.
- Sam beckoned him into the room.
- Sam urged him into the room.
- Sam sent him to the market.
```

3. X ENABLES Y to MOVE Z: This class includes force-dynamic verbs that encode the removal of a barrier.
```
- Sam allowed Bob out of the room.
- Sam let Bill into the room.
- Sam freed the bird out of the cage.
```

4. X PREVENTS Y from MOVING Z: This class imposes a barrier, causing the patient to stay in a location.
```
- Harry locked Joe into the bathroom.
- He kept her at arm's length
- Sam barricaded him out of the room.
```

5. X HELPS Y to MOVE Z: This case involves ongoing assistance to move in a certain direction.
```
- Sam helped him into a car.
- Sam assisted her out of the room.
- Sam guided him through the terrain.
- Sam showed him into the livingroom.
- Sam walked him to the car.
```

### TRAN_RES

In TRAN_RES constructions, a non-stative verb is typically accompanied by a patient argument that experiences a change of state due to the verb's action (Boas, 2002). 
- If the change in state pertains solely to **a change of location**, CAUS_MOT will be assigned. 
- However, if a prepositional phrase is present and describes **a change of state**, then TRAN_RES will be assigned.
- We will categorize the verbs which are lexically causative as TRAN_RES, like *make*, *have*, *let*.

The following are some example sentences (Boas, 2002; Goldberg, 1995).
```
- Claire painted the house red.
- Pat broke the vase (in)to pieces. (check)
- Chris drank himself silly.
- Carol danced Jim tired.
- Rachel swept the floor clean.
- He wiped the table clean.
- He talked himself blue in the face.
- She coughed herself sick.
- She slept herself sober.
- He made the metal safe.
- He made her a queen.
- The judge will take into consideration any previous convictions. (check)
