# Dealing with L2 usage

Often, errors can be found in sentences or utterances, especially in an L2 dataset. Building on the earlier two projects related to L2 English UD treebank (Berzak et al. 2016 & Kyle et al., 2022), we will annotate the ASCs based on their realized form, not their intended meaning, to eliminate any potential influence from the annotators.

## INTRAN_S vs. TRAN_S

- Example 1. *explain about*

  The issue lies with the use of the preposition "about" in this context. In English, when you explain something, you typically use "explain" without a preposition, as it is a transitive verb that takes a direct object. However, in terms of ASC tagging, we rather rely on the realized form and tag it as "INTRAN_S" for the purpose of annotating the L2 dataset based on its actual structure, rather than attempting to infer the intended meaning.
