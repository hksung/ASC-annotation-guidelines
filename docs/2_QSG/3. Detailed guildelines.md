# Detailed guideline

In this section, we will provide more detailed descriptions and examples of the ASC types that we included in the current study. Note that all examples in the following subsections come from the first version of ASC treebank [reference](https://asc-treebank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### ATTR
* The **attributive** (ATTR) ASC includes two arguments, namely a *theme* and an *attribute*. The *attribute* is prototypically represented by a noun phrase, an adjective phrase, or a prepositional phrase. Most commonly, the copular verb *be* is used. The verbs *seem* and *look* also appear frequently with this construction in the EWT/ASCT.

* **Syntactic frame (example)**: Subj-V<sub>copular</sub>-NP/AdjP/PP
* **Semantic frame (example)**: X<sub>theme</sub> is Y<sub>attribute</sub>
