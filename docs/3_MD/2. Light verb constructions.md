# Light verb constructions

Light verb constructions are intricate predicates where the verb loses its semantic meaning. In a sentence like "Henry took a walk," the subject's character isn't acquiring a tangible object, as in "Henry took a spoon." Instead, "take a walk" represents the same event as the verb "walk." Thus, we don't assign "TRAN_S" but rather use "INTRAN_S" in this case (Wittenberg et al., 2014).

- Example 1. *hitch a ride back*
