# Multi-word lexical units

We will treat a multi-word lexical unit as a single semantic unit (i.e., assign a single ASG tag), as the meaning of the multi-word unit derives from the combination of the words, not from the individual meanings of the parts (Biber et al., 1999, p.403).

- A multi-word lexical unit is a sequence of word forms which functions as a single grammatical unit (Biber et al., 1999, p.58).

## Multi-word lexical verbs (Biber et al., 1999, p.403)

```
There are four major kinds of multi-word combination that comprise relatively idiomatic units and function like single verbs:
- verb + adverbial particle: phrasal verbs (e.g., *pick up*)
- verb + preposition: prepositional verbs (e.g., *look at*)
- verb + particle + preposition: phrasal-prepositional verbs (e.g., *get away with*)
- other multi-word verb constructions, notably: verb + noun phrase (+ preposition) e.g., *take a look (at)*; verb + prepositional phrase, e.g., *take into account*; verb + verb e.g., *make do*
```

## Light verb constructions

Light verb constructions are intricate predicates where the verb loses its semantic meaning. In a sentence like "Henry took a walk," the subject's character isn't acquiring a tangible object, as in "Henry took a spoon." Instead, "take a walk" represents the same event as the verb "walk." Thus, we don't assign "TRAN_S" but rather use "INTRAN_S" in this case (Wittenberg et al., 2014).
