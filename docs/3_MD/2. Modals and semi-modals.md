# Modal and semi-modals

We will not tag modal auxiliary verbs because they serve a grammatical function rather than providing semantic content (Similarly, the project does not encompass the tagging of tense-related aspects). The following provides more information on English modals and semi-modals based on Biber et al. (1999, pp.483-484). 

- Nine central modal auxiliary verbs for modality: *can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must*
- Marginal auxiliary verbs (behave like modals in taking auxiliary negation and *yes-no* question inversion): *need (to), ought to, dare (to), used to
- Semi-modals (i.e., a number of fixed idiomatic phrases with functions similar to those of modals): *(had) better, have to, (have) got to, be supposed to, be going to

We will include some of the ver phrases with the force of a hedge (in certain contexts) (pp.944-945): *happen to, tend to be, appear to, (there) is said to be*.
- Example: *happen to*
